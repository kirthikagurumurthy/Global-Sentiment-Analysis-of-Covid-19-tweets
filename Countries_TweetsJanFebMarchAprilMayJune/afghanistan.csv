"This is why I am saying #COVID19 should be dealt in time and cautiously in #Afghanistan. In this video, people in Ghazni are vowing and praying to repel the virus. Afghans — even in major cities — have no proper access to medication. This can be awfully dangerous!"
What measures are in place to prevent public outbreak of the COVID19 ? How well is the quarantine facility secured? Was this person tested and isolated at the airport or was it a reported case of symptoms that led to the discovery of the first COVID19 case in Nigeria?
