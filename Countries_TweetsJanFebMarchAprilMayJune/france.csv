"Why most of the #coronavirus deaths are from old people :
""The use of powerful drugs because doctors are convinced that they have a particularly potent virus on their hands, especially in older people, with pre-existing health conditions, is likely to lead to many deaths"""
"The US has no real, affordable public health insurance/access outside of Medicare/Medicaid/VA, the coronavirus test can cost up to $3K, and you're lucky if you've got maybe three days of sick leave. Sounds like a pandemic in the making. #coronavirususa #CoronavirusOutbreak"
Trump's government withdrew billions of dollas from the CDC and given medical centres inadequate guidelines for testing for Corona Virus. A disaster waiting to happen in the US.
You must know that the cases in Iran are more than what the officials report. The Islamic republic in Iran is hiding the truth and ppl are in danger not even from corona virus also from the government.
