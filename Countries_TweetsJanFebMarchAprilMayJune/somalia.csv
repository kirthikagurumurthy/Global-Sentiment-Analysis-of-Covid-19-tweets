Interesting question. My assumption would be that it is more likely to spurn existing users to engage more often rather than push new users onto a platform. For something like COVID19 the sx can be so non-specific that I’d imagine folks would go to a hospital either way.
Ebola is only infectious during symptomatic stage and during symptomatic stage people are bed ridden unlike covid19 where people are highly infectious while asymptomatic some having no symptoms.. that is why you should be worried about it because it can spread fast.
