It's like the fact that we're only apparently 17 to 15% of the population meanwhile 40% of us so far have contracted the Coronavirus the last time I checked. Personally I blame the fact that not a lot of us have access to decent health care but that's neither here nor there.
I'm not talkin about little nut sacks in particular I'm just saying celebrities in general. If I remember correctly Megan the stallion and Beyonce donated to the coronavirus effort and so did Taylor Swift I believe (kind of iffy on that last one)
Eeeexactly You can't necessarily throw your money everywhere because you still need it at the end of the day but donating to a very important cause towards coronavirus or making your own type of cause or even hosting some type of live stream for charity that would be nice.
Yeah I can get really frustrating when important shit is happening in the world and celebrities decline to comment on a fucking thing. Then again in cases like Vanessa Hudgens and the coronavirus it's just best to shut the fuck up so it depends.
