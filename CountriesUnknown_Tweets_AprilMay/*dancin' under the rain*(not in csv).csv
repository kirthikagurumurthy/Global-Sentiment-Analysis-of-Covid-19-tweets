"Maybe you're the one who doesn't think that, but it actually often happens. I live in Europe and I see lots of people hating asian people living here for tens of years just because ""they all have CHINESE virus"". If they said: ""coronavirus"" this wouldn't happen that much"
"It's not nice because calling it ""Chinese"" (though it does come from China) because it makes you feel like it's unhealthy BECAUSE it comes from China. Subconscious messages sometimes can be tricky, therefore I reckon ""coronavirus"" is easily way better"
