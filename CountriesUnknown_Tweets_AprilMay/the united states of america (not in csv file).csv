CNN: #LasVegas called “ground zero” for economic damage. #coronavirus #COVID19
"I'll tell you this... As an essential employee right now during the #coronavirus, though my hours are horrible and I'm doing work I don't typically do, the hazard pay has been good. No time to spend it. Nor do I really have anything I want to spend it on."
I have a feeling that the Coronavirus is going to disappear very quickly now! 
"No, the coronavirus does not magically go away with time or social distancing. You misunderstand if you think that is what happens."
