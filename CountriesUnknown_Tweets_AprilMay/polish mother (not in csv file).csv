When someone kills themselves because of fear of covid or won't go get treated for something else and dies from that because they fear they will catch it medical professionals say coronavirus is a factor in these OUTCOMES.
Well if someone commits suicide because he has coronavirus he becomes a casualty of the disease just like those who come down with covid and die.
I just saw a video explaining the math. The actual rate of death for coronavirus in the United States could be as high as 20%.
