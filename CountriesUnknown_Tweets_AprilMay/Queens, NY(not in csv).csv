How about news outlets not ask Trump any questions during the Coronavirus press briefings. Only ask the experts. We already know the nonsense that’s going to come out of his mouth...

"I'm not offended, because the news coverage last night did not mention one thing about coronavirus while covering the roots Lot of cops without masks. They all came off when they started fighting. And I don't think does masks can protect you while brawling"
"The governor also called for an end to ""inequality in healthcare,"" with new testing sites in minority communities hit hard by coronavirus. https://trib.al/LNgm8ji"
Neither is the coronavirus. Oh and now it’s ok to riot @georgesoros we see you 
"Daniel I love you, but to blame the entire pandemic on President Trump, and then to blame the “tanking” economy on him (the same economy that was thriving prior to the Chinese Corona Virus) is naive and irresponsible. Not saying he has reacted perfect, but cannot fully blame him."
"Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks out about ""inequality in healthcare"" and announces 10 new testing sites across coronavirus hotspots in New York. https://trib.al/BJnGScm"
"I was for 15 cases of coronavirus going to 0 cases. I was all for coronavirus disappearing like a miracle. I was all for the coronavirus being ""under control"" or ""contained"". I was all for lots of things that Trump was for. The problem was that it was his usual propaganda"
