"Ugh! Nasty Mitt Romney Slams President Trump's Handling of Coronavirus. He also went on to criticize President Trumps move to stop funding to the World Health Organization Mittens, that tells us everything we need to know about you!!! Game Over! "
"Give it up news media, no one cares about coronavirus anymore. I'm more afraid of getting attacked by protesters and rioters than getting the flu."
Can we look into why it was mandated in 2014 to no longer experiment with the coronavirus here in the states? And why did the Obama ministration grant a $3.4 million pay off to a laboratory in Wuhan China about that same time?
