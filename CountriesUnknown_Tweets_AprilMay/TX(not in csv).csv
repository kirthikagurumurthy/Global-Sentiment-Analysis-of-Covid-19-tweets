"Nah, corona virus is very dangerous but theirs a time and place for everything. Their are places in the US that are safe to open. We were blessed with human brains. The local governments know best when,it comes to closing and opening business and public places."
If you were the president right now- we would barely even be familiar w/the #coronavirus . The media would have never over-hyped it &amp; bullied everyone into crashing the economy with a shutdown. They would have coddled you so hard &amp; told us it was the flu. So thereâ€™s that. #Biden
Coronavirus made it clear who our friends are.
