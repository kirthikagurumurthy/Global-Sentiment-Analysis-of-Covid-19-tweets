"60,000+ dead -- in two months -- out of 320,000,000 doesn't seem that bad to the GOP. What would change their mind? #Covid19 #coronavirus"
"I just want Kushner, 45, Ivanka, etc, come down with #coronavirus and say, if they survive, that the number of deaths was a ""success story."" That of course will never happen because their too chicken to step outside the WH."
"It falls apart when you're in charge. Your response to this was, at least, quicker than your response to coronavirus. 100,000 American families and their friends won't forget by November."
And it’s failed. Miserably. Unfortunately ppl aren’t programmed to just hand over power cuz it’s the right thing to do. 400 yrs of oppression has also meant 400 yrs of whites convincing themselves they deserve what they have. We don’t. At least not exclusively. There’s plenty. 
And it doesn’t even affect me personally. I can’t imagine the pain and fury of seeing your own go through this over & over & over & over. The only power to change it is this. So this is what we get. White ppl don’t like it? Then fucking help change it. The end.
None of this shit should need to happen. It’s been 65 damn years since Emmitt Till. 55 since Selma. 25 since Rodney King. Why are we still trying to convince cops not to indiscriminately beat & kill black men? Why do we still need this conversation? It’s pathetic & pisses me off.
"You understand I’m in support of the protests and protestors, I hope. This shit HAS to stop. (The racism &amp; killing of POC, not the riots.) I just hate to see black biz or any small biz suffer because of it. It’s a sad consequence that I wish could be avoided. That’s all."
