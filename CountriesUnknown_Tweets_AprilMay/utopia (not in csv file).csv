"Hi Jim ,hello everyone and ahlan to Sudan. the weather today is absolutely hot , with high expectations of we all going to die from the corona virus back to you at the mic again Jim."
"if you guys think 100,000 coronavirus deaths (and still counting) is good, let me tell about this xi jinping guy, he can deal with it for a fraction of the price and only costing 1/20 of the death toll, truly a miracle. better yet, Vietnam: masters of killing corona and Yankees"
"And it ain't only about black people, it's about poo people in general . you guys have the highest coronavirus death toll in the planet by a huge margin. in many ways china is a better place to live in 2020, not so much in others"
