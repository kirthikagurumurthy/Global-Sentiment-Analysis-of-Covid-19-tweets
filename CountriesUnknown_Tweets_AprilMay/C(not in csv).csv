"Rachel, stop that! You’re better than that! The number of coronavirus cases has gone way down. Most states — including CA — are opening up. What you’re doing is misleading and frightening people unnecessarily. This is a nation wide pandemic. You should be helping not hurting "
"Well, at least we’re not worried about coronavirus anymore. That’s a relief!"
