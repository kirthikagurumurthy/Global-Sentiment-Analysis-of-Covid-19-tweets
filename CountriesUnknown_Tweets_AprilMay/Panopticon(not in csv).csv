@realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden I learned about the existence of the Republican playbook about the response to the Coronavirus today.
"OK. Do you know about the @politico article published in April about the official American, Republican playbook to the response on the Coronavirus?"
"Look at how suspect this is, is this referring to the Coronavirus article that someone bothered to write in English, essentially, “People are trying to say this peer-reviewed on Coronavirus testing is response for the outbreak and it isn’t true.” That’s a red flag to me. "
"Let me think. Look at the language, the lab was best known for novel Coronavirus studies. The government denies that China was slow to disclose information about the outbreak. Why would denying response to an outbreak occur at all if the virus “could not be made there?” "
