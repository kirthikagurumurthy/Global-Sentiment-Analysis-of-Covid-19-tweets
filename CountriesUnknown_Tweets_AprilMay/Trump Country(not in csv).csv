If making history means chasing retailers out of your city and infecting your buddies with coronavirus then yes. History. I see it happening.
"Honestly, most countries effectively already have martial law due to coronavirus. Our govt has been going easy on us... it just couldn't last."
Hopefully none of your family is out (a) contracting coronavirus in what would in most countries be a period of martial law and (b) helping to chase retail out of your city forever.
"I'm questioning whether there will ever be retail again in the regions that break out in those coronavirus-loving riots. Am saying this somewhat in jest, of course. The whole thing is silly."
Riots would assumably optimize the spread of coronavirus. Interesting strategy... not a strategy at all I mean. About all it is is entertainment from a sort of fake crisis... during a real crisis.
It wouldn't be the first time. The real issue I think would be optimizing a response that results in the fewest number of people contracting coronavirus. Would suck if a lot of people got sick as a result of the riots.
"They're out there risking contact with Coronavirus. In this situation the police I think have greater justification than usual to use a large show of force. Better to break up a crowd so they don't have to be put in the pokey + contract corona, etc."
