"And if it was just one past coronavirus, as long as people are old enough to have been exposed to it, no age group is likely wildly different from the others in terms of the chances whether they were infected."
Several different classes of viruses give humans the things we call common colds. A few of them are coronaviruses. It may have been just one past coronavirus that did this and that coronavirus has only infected 50 to 60% of the population.
"This virus had to be milder than the present Coronavirus, it would be quite something if we could find it, study it, and start spreading it on purpose, assuming it is deemed safe."
"These studies are too small to be conclusive about the whole population, but they are strongly suggestive. The T cell response to some earlier coronavirus common cold has rendered much of the population resistant. This maybe 1 reason why there are so many asymptomatic cases."
