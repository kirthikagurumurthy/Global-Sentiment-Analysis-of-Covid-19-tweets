" “U.S. coronavirus death toll is far higher than reported, data suggests” by @nytimes"
" “""Frostbite"" toes and rashes may be signs of a coronavirus infection” by @washingtonpost"
So basically everything is the fucking coronavirus!?!
"Not Afraid of coronavirus no more ? Don’t worry we got that coverd , hold my beer ."
"Kinda feels like Trump is giving Dem governors just enough rope to hang themselves with, starting with coronavirus and now these riots .. exposes Dems ineptitude"
It could end up getting millions of deaths by 2021 for the coronavirus.
"Worldwide death toll is now 369,392 for the coronavirus pandemic and getting closer to 400,000 deaths very soon by the month of June 2020."
2nd wave of the coronavirus is coming in the Fall or Winter 2020 so be prepare.
