Hope you're right. There's never been a coronavirus vaccine before. But I suppose there's never been such an effort to come up with one before either. NZ is a remote island nation that did not have wide community spread in late February when they acted.
"New Zealand isn't back to normal either. Can't travel there without quarantining, etc. They're hoping the rest of the world frees them from this with a vaccine, but there's no guarantee of a coronavirus vaccine."
