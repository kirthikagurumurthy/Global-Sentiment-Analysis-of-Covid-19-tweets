There are so many similar stories like this happening now. We were already hurting from coronavirus and it looked like we were just about to start slowly coming back. Now we are in even worse shape than before. My heart is breaking for my city and for this country 
@PhillyMayor Hey Jimmy aren't we still in Code Red? What happened to the lockdown and social distancing? #coronavirus
