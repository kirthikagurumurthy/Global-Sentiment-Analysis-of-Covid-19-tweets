Haven’t ate out ever since way before quarantine and corona virus and today is my first time having a eat out in a long time but OUTSIDE spread out if it’s indoors forget it!!
I applauded the protest but don’t applauded being around so many people standing all on them um corona virus is still highly out there but the protest I understand!!!
