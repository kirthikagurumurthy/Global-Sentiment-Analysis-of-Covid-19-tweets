when do you ladies and gents think the day will come when we’re all like “do you remember coronavirus?”
"haven’t been able to sleep, worried sick about my Black friends who are hurting, friends who are at the protests that could potentially get violent AND on top of that - possibly be exposed to coronavirus... Pls be safe yall, and wear masks at the protests #JusticeForFloyd"
"Should I be honest? Both the Government and the citizens are tired of this corona virus. People don't care anymore, they go about their normal lives unbothered."
So about that super duper deadly corona virus ?
Especially when minority communities have been horrifically impacted in disproportionate numbers by the coronavirus.
