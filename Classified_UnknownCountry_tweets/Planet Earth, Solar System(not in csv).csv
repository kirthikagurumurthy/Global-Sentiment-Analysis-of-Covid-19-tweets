Now I know that we are in good hands, two holy men with strong connections to the Almighty and hence capable of performing Miracles! I only wish they would have thrown in a couple of Ayatollahs!","@realDonaldTrump, very uncharacteristically, did not downplay the threat of the coronavirus nor did he say that the Economy was in great shape! In fact, he conceded that we are heading towards RECESSION! Why such a sudden change of course? He is scared SHITLESS! bc he canâ€™t BS!"
