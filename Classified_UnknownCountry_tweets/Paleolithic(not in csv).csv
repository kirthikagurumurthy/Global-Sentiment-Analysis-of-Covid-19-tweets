1,Why are we the only first world country with no test kits? Anyone? #2019nCoV #covid19 ,"CDC talking about so few cases in California, like idiots, and the reporter points out the governor said there were only 200 test kits available. CDC's answer? Double talk about it being an evolving situation blah blah blah. #covid19 #2019nCoV"
2,"And the plan that was supposed to happen a week ago, where we test people with pneumonia that's not the flu at 5 different cities? Maybe next week, who knows. #covid19 #2019nCoV","The government lies on pandemics. Flu View is the CDC weekly report. During the flu pandemic scare, the number of sick spiked one week, from other sources, but Flu View wasn't published/on-line that week to prevent panic. But the gov't told their own families. #coronavirus"
3,"They're apologizing about not being able to test anyone. Lots of double-talk to excuse it. Plans for having test kits like the rest of the planet, but not sure when. In the meantime, just skip the third step in the existing defective test kits, good enough. #2019nCoV #covid19 ","It stands resolved, none of these lying vermin can show how an R0 <10 can double the infected every two days. 

Because it's impossible. Anyone that can do elementary arithmetic can check that for themselves.

5,"2.5!!!!! Even 1.4, no way they can stop this one from spreading everywhere.

#nCoV2019 #Coronavirus https://twitter.com/V2019N/status/1220420670716305410 …","At the peak of the 1918 Pandemic, in the US, there was no medical care, they all went home. And as the gov't told everyone it was OK, people were dragging the bodies of their familes out into the streets. And the loss of credibility caused more death.

6,"Looks like the Kingdom of Communist Korea cares more about it's citizens than Western countries. They may be the last ones left alive.

#nCoV2019 #coronavirus","Sucks being a pessimist when you are proved right. 

Yeah, it's time to panic.
