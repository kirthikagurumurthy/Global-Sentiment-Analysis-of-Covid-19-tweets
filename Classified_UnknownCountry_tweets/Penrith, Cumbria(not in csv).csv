1,This was going to be me but work decided to delay the Venice trip... coronavirus a becoming a rather big inconvenience to me now  https://twitter.com/AyoCaesar/status/1235162766459232256 …,"Did you know the official name of #Coronavirus is “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, or SARS-CoV-2, because it is related to the virus that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003. However @WHO calls it the #COVID19 virus when communicating with the public."
2,Think we are hours from going over the edge with fact oil has taken such a hit and gold spikes. Big stock jitters from CoronaVirus over last week will see markets open with down ward losses and a big sell that could push us into a global crash fast.,
