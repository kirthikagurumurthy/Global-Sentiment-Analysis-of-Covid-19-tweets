1,No the one from China is called novel coronavirus R2 I think? So noCor12,Yes what you all have is a very nasty cold. Very stupid woman to use the word coronavirus
2,Coronavirus is a word like flu or cold. It’s the type of virus. The one that’s just been released from China is a new one just like everything is and we have new flu or a new cold,Did they tell you to stay home or anything like... I’m sorry but wtf is happening? They told you this is the actual novel corona virus of the famed pandemic? And they... told you to ride out the breathing issues?
3,"There’s coronavirus, which we know about. Moves like a cold with symptoms like a lighter influenza A. But it’s not the NOVEL aka NEW virus from China.","If anyone is scared or doesn’t get it and has a bottle of glen 20 or disinfect around with a list of what it combats? It’s very likely it says cold germs, flu germs, coronavirus. It’s not a new word just new to many."
4,Ok. So I want to explain something real quick. The reason this China flu is such a big deal is that it’s a new coronavirus. Coronavirus is usually just a cold. This one is scary bc it moves like a cold that takes you down like a flu. If what you have is a simple coronavirus ur ok,
5,"Apparently one does not simply mention oh I might do a video on the coronavirus looks like it’s the Americans and the just go to sleep. Now I have to do it. 

Ok I am gonna but I need all day to verify these sources I’m not gonna hack it so patience my pets",
