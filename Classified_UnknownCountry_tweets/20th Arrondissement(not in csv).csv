1,"""The 1st “community spread” of #coronavirus in the US arose from infection via workers who were exposed to evacuees with #COVID19. All because Trump’s @HHSGov didn’t properly train or protect its workers, risking us all. Never trust #Republicans with your health. @AARP","Wow! Ebenezer Trump met with Big Pharma and now the @GOP is holding up funding #coronavirus aid until they get to shake the taxpayer down.

Never, ever trust the #Republicans. Even now -- look at what they are doing.

#Resistance @TheDemocrats"
