1,From another poster. I wasn’t sure if I should attach their name to my own statement because I am not intended on adding anything except to say I am concerned about Coronavirus numbers going up.,I am sad of all the racially motivated violence. I am afraid that things won’t change. I am afraid of people getting killed in these protests from escalating violence at them. I am afraid of the potential surge in Coronavirus numbers. The year of 2020 has made me sad &amp; afraid. 
2,I completely understand the desire to be there today given the horrors happening with racism right now. Make your voice heard. It makes me afraid of a surge in Coronavirus sicknesses. Please wear a mask everybody!! ,
