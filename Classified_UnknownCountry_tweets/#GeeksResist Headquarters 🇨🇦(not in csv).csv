1,Another great source of medical info is @GovCanHealth. They just retweeted the @WHO announcement. #CoronaVirus ,"See, there’s no magic. It’s DIY. #CoronaVirus PS... fake news purveyors and fearmongers will be shunned and possibly blocked, so do yourselves a favour and stay away. Thank-you for your attention. Clare "
2,"The @CDCgov is a good, accurate source of information. They will likely be posting at least daily updates about the coronavirus. #CoronaVirus ","There are many instances of #FakeNews I’ve seen online about this coronavirus already. Don’t drink bleach (could be deadly, even if diluted.) Corona Beer does not cause the virus. There is also no evidence that Corona Beer or other alcoholic beverages will cure this virus. "
3,"The World Health Organization has declared #2019nCoV a public health emergency. Please read their thread. Below, I’ll post a few other reputable sites to get info from. I also suggest staying away from the fearmongers and sites that say they “have a cure”. #CoronaVirus ",
