1,"Looks like we may have another exotic coronavirus unleashed from some animal (?) at a Chinese animal market.
Similar to SARS back in 2003.
Not much so far to tell us how far this one will go.

2,"There are many endgames proposed now, like the Kirshner version- now that there are zero constraints on #Spanky.

*Blame Democrats, Obama, Hillary Clinton",

Next week: Hunter Biden leading MS13 caravans from Guatemala bearing #coronavirus, and no doubt, tats on their NECKS! pic.twitter.com/dcYYq82lEJ",
8,"Don't tell us you need that pedicure.
Don't go to that sports contest. 
Not a word about that great concert.

YOU TOO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY.
