1,Thank Christos!  So the range of mortality associated with patients hospitalized with pneumonia due to Coronavirus is somewhere between 5.7% and up to 19%  ... very very broad https://twitter.com/ChristosArgyrop/status/1222667015363682304 …,"Locust swarms the size of cities Ebola Coronavirus Poverty, famine, deaths of despair 2020 has been off to a rough start ... Hoping we turn the corner soon"
2,"150,000 patients were admitted this year in the US with the flu and 8,000 died. That is 5%, not 10% as you state. The confidence interval around that number is much tighter than that for Coronavirus and we have greater certainty around that 5% number.",

4,"These are 99 people hospitalized with Coronavirus pneumonia and 11 died, that is 11%. I hope we can agree on that fact. The confidence interval is quite broad though.",
