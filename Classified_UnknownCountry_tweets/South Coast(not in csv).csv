1,Worth remembering police are still trying to combat crime on Dorset's streets alongside the coronavirus situation. ,Couldn’t GAF what Cummings did or didn’t do tbh. It won’t change the general public’s conduct during the pandemic. We will all act as we see fit to protect our loved ones. The media gleefully whip up hysteria to suit their own agendas. We shall ignore their bias imo. #coronavirus
