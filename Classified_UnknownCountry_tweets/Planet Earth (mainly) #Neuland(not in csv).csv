1,"1. And he is one expert: I have seen a number of virologists, including those I RT on Twitter. So far none of them back up the above claim. In summary they say that it is a fairly typical RNA-#CoronaVirus (others existed before), but may be transmitted easier, mutates faster,",Looks more like you and your friends like #Merkel &amp; #VonDerLeyen want to take the #COVID19-virus as an excuse for more social engineering and pushing your globalist agenda! We have survived much worse than the #Coronavirus! #Soros
2,"4. Concerning is that the likes of the #WHO only provide very limited clear information on the #CoronaVirus: Original source, when the peak will be reached & when an inoculation will be available ALL still unclear. #COVID","1. On the death rate we have too lttle certainty: Example - In greater #Wuhan over 4.000 people have been infected with the #CoronaVirus, but only 90 fully recovered so far. So only once most recovered will we know."
3,"2. What gives me hope: As far as I know only one person died of #COVID19 outside #China. But all these patients have access to good hospitals & ICU-wards.

4,"I agree the best information on the #CoronaVirus in #China has to come from locals.
If you consider that 760 million people are on #lockdown, that most international airlines stopped all flights to China & that trade is severely impacted, it all speaks a clear language:#REDALERT!",#Lagarde & the #FED scare me a hundred times more than the #CoronaVirus!
5,,"One day another Spanish Flu-Virus (1918) will hit us.
Question is only when!
#SARS was not it (but certainly serious).
The normal #flu in 2019 still killed many more than the #CoronaVirus."
6,,"Concerned.
Watch the data.
If instances reach dozens or hundreds close to home take precautions.
Don't party in #Macau, don't go on a ""round the globe cruise ship"", don't hang around in international airports unless necessary!
