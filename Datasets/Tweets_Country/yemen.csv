"Today's 5 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in my hometown Aden brings the total confirmed cases in #Yemen to 6. While it seems low, Yemen's been devastated by the genocidal Saudi/US-led war/blockade &amp; is therefore completely unequipped to test for cases or treat coronavirus patients. "
"1.Taha Al-Mutawakel’s claim that Houthis discovered Coronavirus treatment while world's labs couldn’t failed so far, is senseless &amp;hiding No’s. of infections due 2inefficiency of tests provided by WHO as he claim.Who failed 2diagnose the disease, how could he develop the vaccine? "
