"One thing seems clear, though: this is a coronavirus, which can spread through the air(same family as the flu), rather than a filovirus like ebolaviridae which can't, so in a busy city like Wuhan in the middle of China, things could move faster than HK."
"We don't know which family the virus comes from, but  CoV(coronavirus) is most likely, and human to human transmission is guaranteed by those numbers. Since it infects the breathing system, it's spread by aerosol, which is bad. It's fast and efficient. One sneeze in an airport..."
"We'll see what variant of coronavirus we're dealing with soon, I hope. I can't believe the sequence still isn't out.  Surely there's been a gain of function or important mutation, or it is indeed plain SARS and they don't want to freak out Chinese people.  My bet's on the latter."
"That, and it depends on how efficiently and how far this spreads.  Given how fast coronavirus mutates and recombinates, we could be dealing with a virus that is very different from SARS.  SARS apparently had an R0 of 2-4, which is very high."
"If any virus is going to mutate, it's a coronavirus. Both an unstable genome(I forget how many base pairs per generation) and the unique ability to recombinate(hence labeling by antigens, like H3N2, etc."
"I can confirm from inside information that this is not a known coronavirus, adenovirus, or avian flu.  That doesn't rule out other recombinants or mutations of the flu, but it makes it unlikely.  Probably a coronavirus."
Talk about #coronavirus ??
China pneumonia illness outbreak may be from new coronavirus http://bit.ly/37OTFPd 
"The virus circulating in China now has been described as a novel coronavirus, much like SARS was.  He says it's not SARS, but it's from the same family.  Still a lot to learn about it.

Again, very high mutation rate(base pairs x time) and recombination."
