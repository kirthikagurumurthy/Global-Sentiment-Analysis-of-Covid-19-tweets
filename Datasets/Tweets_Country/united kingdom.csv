For e.g. Recent figures are 7680 ppl infected; 170 deaths (all in China) = 2.2% mortality rate (I’ve seen 3% quoted). Compare with 2003 SARS epidemic (also coronavirus) = 11% mortality. (0%-50% depending on age-group).

"#BREAKING: Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte has confirmed Italy's first two cases of the Novel #Coronavirus."
"@MickWhitleyMP We need your intervention to stop the government from using our local hospital for potential #coronavirus quarantine, this is placing patients at risk in a hospital already at breaking point #NHSCrisis"
Fucking loving the fact that the corona virus evacuees are headed to the wirral.... Can't they send them to some remote island first?

I wonder if Judge Tayler has read this extract from the BBC website regarding the spread of the corona virus @MForstater ? Perhaps it’s just as well Dr Li lives in China since I guess his comments on sex would be ruled as “not worthy of respect in a democratic society”.

Please don’t let the hype on covid19 upset you. It seems less unpleasant to have than many flus and has same infection rate and same mortality rate. Every year ppl die through flu but it goes unreported! Take sensible care. My sympathy to those like me with compromised immunity.
#StockMarketCrash2020 How will the US cope with Covid19 when they don't have free health care?
Spreading covid19 and bullshit
"For the past 2 days, the number of new #COVID19 cases reported in the rest of the has exceeded the number of new cases in . #Coronavid19 #FridayThoughts"
"So many locally transmitted cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran. Is China under reporting the number of cases or do people just not go out of their houses? #COVID19 "
"Very sensible, though slightly alarmed about food stocking. It's only human to be alarmed but good common sense is essential and also very human. #coronavirus #COVID19 @roblake1959 @RajThamotheram @WHO"
"We doubt the official figures for the total number of #covid19 outbreaks in China, Iran, etc., but how truthful are the UK being with us? Hmmmm?"
"Just to say, Lunar, I too am in vulnerable group with impaired immune system. But please don’t let scaremongering frighten you. Covid19 is as contagious as other flu and not as bad to get as some, it has the same level of mortality as other flu. Just take care and don’t worry"
A good read on a community approach to help flatten the #Covid19 curve 
you forgot masks- we sent all ours to china free- billions worth and they are selling them back to us for like $1000 for 100 throw away surgical masks- everything has skyrockets #trump #COVID19 #Masks #CannotAffordThem

This is a very sensible article on #coronavirus - that explodes the myth that it's 'just the flu'. Definitely worth your time to read. #coronavirusuk #COVID19 
"Ask yourself, if you’re on the breadline, know you won’t get sick pay or can’t survive on SSP and you’re showing #Covid19 symptoms what would you do? Self isolate or go and earn the money you need to survive?"
Perhaps it’s time workers were treated fairly? Perhaps it’s about time to get rid of zero hours contracts except for those who actively want them? Perhaps it’s time to even out sick pay? Perhaps it’s time to treat workers as the assets they are. Maybe #Covid19 will show this.
"People are being told to self isolate over corona virus fears. Some will, some however who are on zero hours contracts or don’t get sick pay will feel they have no choice but to go to work despite showing symptoms of #Covid19. Worrying thought!"

"This has, obviously, knock on effects even if you are not personally sick. The distribution of resources is partly why delaying the spread is important. Having covid19 at the same time as seasonal flu is just worse for the system than having them one after the other."
"30,000 people in the UK die from pneumonia each year. That's 80 a day, every day. We have circa 20 so far in total. People need to get it into perspective. And yes, sensible precautions such as washing hands go a long way in helping the spread of Covid19 et al."
"This is the best data sheet I’ve seen yet on who dies from #covid19 - based on over 1,000 deaths (more than 1/3 of all deaths globally) Young children 100% survive, and 99% of all those up to 60. Men over 80 are the most at risk (but most survive) "
"I am not having sleepless nights over Covid19 if it happens it happens. Seasonal flu kills 291,000 to 646,000 people worldwide each year. I think the press are drumming up the headlines because they can’t scare us about Brexit so let’s report on the Covid19 just my personal view"

"Most people outside of Asia I know seem to be talking about COVID19 wholly in terms of how likely it is for individuals to die from it. Which isn't a super high % (though calculations wary) Which makes it very easy for ppl to ask, well why are we working so hard to contain it."

I have to ask why do @BBCNews @SkyNews @itvnews keep telling us the amount of people who were infected with COVID19?. 19 They keep say knowing full well at least 8 have recovered and gone home. Lets keep the figures to those currently infected and NOT those who were!!

"The #coronavirus (at present anyhow) is a fairly mild condition most people recover from. However, for a minority #COVID19 is life or death and patients need intensive care including tracheal intubation. This hospital in Wuhan looks excellent, whether it's typical I don't know. "
"In the current #Covid19 situation remember: Wash your hands regularly Clean work areas thoroughly Cover w tissue when coughing/sneezing Use hand sanitiser as often as needed Do not touch eyes, ears or mouth Wear face masks in public Stay safe everyone #coronavirus #Uk #osr"
"Encouraging kids to play skip school just to listen to attend the #GretaThunberg #ClimateStrike is irresponsible enough but gathering 20,000 kids together in the middle of a REAL emergency, a potential global #pandemic of #COVID19 #coronavirusus is frankly beyond reckless? @LBC"
"Just wondering...wear'g masks in China is nothing new, & the increase since Covid19 didn't stop the speed of the spread amongst the population &amp; health workers wearing mask &amp; PPE...IMHO the washing of hands and stopping the touching of face &amp; eyes is good advice &amp; a lot cheaper"
"The swine flu pandemic in 2009 had a fatality rate 0.01% - 0.08%. COVID19 is currently 3.4%. Globally seasonal flu is 0.05 - 0.1%. Flu kills more people only because it is more wide spread. COVID19 is currently regional outbreaks, but we are on the verge of a pandemic."

Hope you can answer a Q for me. As I understand it - there is distinction between #CoronaVirus (infection) and disease #Covid19 (symptoms)- one causes other. But you can have virus and not disease - right? So when reports say 78k cases in China do they mean virus or disease?
