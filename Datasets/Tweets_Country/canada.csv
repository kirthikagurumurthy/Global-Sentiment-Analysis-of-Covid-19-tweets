Coronavirus: WHO declares global emergency but stresses confidence in China – live news 
"Levi Strauss shuts half its China stores on coronavirus outbreak, expects financial hit. "
"The Wuhan coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, has infected at least 8,100 people in mainland China and killed 171 people. Over 100 cases have been reported overseas, the vast majority of which were recent travellers to Hubei province"
We can’t. China’s Communist government is rarely forthcoming about anything. But I agree with Urback that information coming from China about the coronavirus has been more plentiful as compared to SARS. 
I’ve seen so many white people bring up how it’s the Chinese population’s fault that the corona virus is an epidemic because of what they eat But those same white people would let their dog lick food off their teeth 
The earlier they staunch the spread the better. It's true more people have already died from the seasonal flu this year but left to spread the coronavirus could quickly change that.
There has already been an economic hit. It's only going to get worse. #coronavirus
"I honestly cannot believe that the Wirral is trending on Twitter and it’s all because of coronavirus, incredibly poor PR for the Mersey Riviera"
Not true. Coronavirus is a classification for a group of viruses. There has been ONE patent from a strain seen before. What we are seeing today is a new strain (or member) of the Coronavirus group.

I have a strong feeling that the Coronavirus is going to be the beginning of the end for the #CCP. The epidemic seems out of control in China and the cities under quarantine are going to run into logistical problems sooner than later. Social harmony is going to be a tough sell.

You can't argue against the poor monitoring of health and food conditions found in China. It's not a racial thing but more of an economic environment thing. Nobody is enforcing better conditions. This is why viruses like SARS and nor coronavirus are birthed in that region.

"Podcast Audio: @MarinHHS's Dr. Lisa Santora, recently talked with @KWMRradio about novel coronavirus #COVID19, measures local officials have taken to prepare for a potential outbreak, myths about the virus, and tips to prevent illness in #MarinCounty:"
Coming back to the “Spanish Flu”: The 100+ years since that pandemic have seen enormous leaps in our ability to deal with disease. So there are good reasons to hope that—with intelligent decisions and swift execution—the #COVID19 epidemic won't be nearly as bad.
"Also, we have a vaccine for measles, but not for #COVID19. And yes, researchers are working hard on one, but it's not going to be available this season. (And it's not clear how long it would remain effective—the seasonal flu mutates so fast that a new vaccine is needed each year)"
"Note that #COVID19 is not nearly as contagious as measles, and not nearly as deadly as MERS, but the combination of contagiousness and deadliness could turn it into a global health disaster."
"Putting these two factors together, here's how #COVID19 compares to other diseases and pandemics, from this very good @nytimes explainer: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html"
"Of course, #COVID19 is nowhere near that bad yet. The concern is that (a) it's spreading rapidly, and that (b) it may have a high case-fatality rate. I am *not an expert* on these matters, and our knowledge on this is evolving rapidly, but here's what I understand so far:"
"I am comforted by the fact that there is excellent ongoing collaboration, communication and cooperation among health and emergency partners in our community when it comes to #COVID19, giving me confidence that we are ready if and when the virus arrives "
"I warned health officials a couple weeks ago abt #Iran #COVID19 imported to Iran by IRGC's #MahanAir. Now that we have the 3rd positive case in Ont from IRAN, why is Canada still so careless about protecting Canadians?Is Canada deliberately allowing the virus spread here?"

"I think that's part of it, but also covid19 tests are expensive in the US, so if everyone who attends GDC &amp; gets typical con crud (I've never attended GDC &amp; not gotten sick) has to get tested to rule out covid19 that's gonna be a huge $burden on both the employees &amp; the company"

I'm about as scared of Covid19 as I am of the flu. While currently the mortality rate of Covid19 is much higher than influenza it also hasn't spread to as many people. As numbers of infected increase the mortality rate will plummet. 80-90% of cases are mild or asymptomatic so...
Tell trump covid19 is on all us currency and especially virulent on golf courses. You'll have full funding that day for healthcare.
Mortality rate Flu is .1. % Rate for covid19 is (at minimum) 2.0% that’s 20 times plus infection rate for flu is .14 and for this virus it’s 2.3 to 4.0.

Some needed perspective on the #Coronavirus #COVID19 from the CDC 
There many unknowns regarding #COVID19 but there also many things we know. @NUSMedicine is publishing a great set of chronicles: https://nusmedicine.nus.edu.sg/medias/news-info/2233-the-covid-19-chronicles

There are no definitive answers to #COVID19 until the pandemic is over. Everyone including virologists are playing guessing games. Only 2 things can be done: prevention and survival. The best option is prevention. Survival is always a guessing game.
Agree; but riddled with challenges; politics trumps collective responsibility; raising global funds for outbreaks hard - both demonstrated in #covid19 - need to readdress duplicated streams of governance between @WHO and @WorldBank
"Can anyone remember if a vaccine was developed for SARS? They say one for COVID19 will take at least a year, if not 18 months, before general availability, which probably means the virus will disappear mostly of its own account. Spanish influenza of 1918 still the most deadly?"
Nothing is certain but yes I think this could get much worse. We can manage cancer care for the patients that need it but getting a surge of #COVID19 patients would be extremely challenging. But yes cancer is devastating and hard to compare it to this.
"What this small study doesn’t say is about 1 in 3 samples in known #COVID19 patients were -ve, and in 1 in 3 patients a negative result was followed by a positive Are false negatives common in infectious patients? "
Hope you survive round 2 of #COVID19 Russian Roulette. These people are just now getting round 2 of infections so we don’t know.
"Because most active ingredients for pharmaceuticals are produced in China, #covid19 might create a new wave of drug shortages. "
Suspect it will be Covid19 but that’s probably part of their eugenicist thinking anyway.

"The most concerning thing Jim is that a significant percentage of those that get #COVID19, get it again. There is no immunity to #coronavirus once you recover."
You're correct the number of proven cases is low for now. But based on the math of #COVID19 spread I think this will not be the case for long. Just my view...

Bitch stfu! My post was about the coronavirus not your stupid ass orange president.
I suggest adding a new Kit based on a Pandemic. This is not to start a panic but what we now know about the Coronavirus is that it incubates in a person for up to 2 weeks and during that time the person is contagious but shows no symptoms. How many carriers have arrived already?
My elderly mother is scheduled to depart this week on a 28  day cruise and ALL ports have cases of coronavirus.  She called @hollandamerica to see if she could receive a refund or voucher. The answer was NO.  #coronavirus #badcustomerservice
That is NOTHING to protect you from this Coronavirus. There is no vaccine so avoid Mall crowds and wear gloves if shaking hands.
