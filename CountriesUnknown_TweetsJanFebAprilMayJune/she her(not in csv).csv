She was literally protesting against the corona virus lockdown laws .
"in the uk it‚Äôs one of the main headlines but i‚Äôm that doesn‚Äôt mean people see it, coronavirus news has become its own section that‚Äôs always at the top of any news website and takes up most of news broadcasts. not many ppl off twt are talking about it"
"If I was a business owner watching 30 cities burning over the last 4 days, I would probably try and protect my investments too. Some of these folks barely survived the coronavirus shutdowns."
"i‚Äôm heading off for today,,, remember to stay safe for both coronavirus and protests if you‚Äôre going &amp; not to praise rich white men for doing the bare minimum &lt;3"

"Don‚Äôt talk to me tomorrow. Katie Hopkins may have gotten suspended ( ), but Brexit is here. We still have 5 more years of the Tories. Piers Morgan is still on tv and Tommy Robinson and his fans are still a disease. The UK in 2020. Coronavirus cannot get us fast enough #brexiteve"

"I think abt this a lot for #COVID19. For those who have worked in the service industry or have family who currently do, then I don‚Äôt have to explain just how difficult/impossible it is to ‚Äútake off work‚Äù or ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù. Not possible w/o pay cut &amp; many just can‚Äôt afford that. "
