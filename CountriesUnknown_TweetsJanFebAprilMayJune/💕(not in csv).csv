"You should see the Netherlands. The local health authorities (@rivm &amp; @GGDGHORNL) are basing their containment, quarantine &amp; testing strategy on the ""fact"" that ONLY #COVID19 patients with symptoms can transmit the #coronavirus. Asymptomatic transmission aren't recognized. Crazy!"
"Making mistakes is human & understandable indeed, but taking steps that others have found to be wrong & repeating them stubbornly isn't. By following the development in China, Korea, Japan & Italy, many unnecessary missteps can be avoided by dealing with #COVID19."
Indeed - complex & unprecedented. Yet what about the route @rivm has taken by having for granted that #COVID19 can be transmitted ONLY by symptomatic persons?There's enormous medical support for #asymptomatic transmissions of #SARS_CoV_2. Here (3min03sec):
Watch it. He goes deeper in #COVID19 being infectious way before any symptoms appear. Basically asymptomatic. The Dutch authorities are in a big big big mess how they are being handling the #CoronavirusOutbreak in the #Netherlands..
Here is the latest video of Dr #JohnCampbell where he touches on the survival of #COVID19 &amp; #SARS_CoV_2 on surfaces + more: https://youtu.be/cmIRMHzBZdU ( about him: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnscottlewinski/2020/02/07/uk-doctor-uses-youtube-to-treat-panic-of-coronavirus-myths/#2038857d2c51) .
"Nope. The #Dutch health authorities &amp; government have been aggressively (and arrogantly) pushing weeks old facts &amp; info already rejected by the world #COVID19 &amp; #SARS_CoV_2 experts &amp; researchers. Not only old, but also dangerously contradicting the presents facts. Flabbeegasting!"
And the #Dutch #Wuhan evacuees were required to stay at home and ONLY to keep 2 metres distance from their house mates and family. This is absolutely inefficient and amateurish by any world #health standards to keep a #COVID19 &amp; #SARS_CoV_2 #quarantine. By a mile (not just 2m) 
I doubt they do that after every card (or even often) they do touch. This could be very dangerous for the @NS_online staff and the general public in #COVID19 epidemic circumstances.
.@NS_online please do check the international organisations and experts recommendations about dealing with #COVID19. 
#COVID19 advice thread worth checking 
Indeed. I'm married to a #Dutch. Our kid was born a&amp; we live here in the #NL. I'm generally surprised to see how shortsighted the NL authorities (@rivm) have been so far. This is a global crisis &amp; not being aware of the rapidly developing #COVID19 situation could be disastrous.
I work in Dutch #pgb #zorg. Few weeks ago I was with a client in #ICU #RadboudUMC for 36h. He needed oxygen (O2). Not many realize how limited such facilities are. Even in the #NL. Also what amount of care us needed for a single person on 02. &gt;10% of #COVID19 sick need 02
"No flights from #China (yes, they are still serviced by @ChinaSouthernEU instead @KLM ) or countries having recent #CoronavirusOutbreak have been monitored. See examples of arrivals on #schiphol from yesterday... #covid19 "
