"That's the common cold, not the Wuhan Coronavirus which is new."
"Look at the picture again. At the top of the label it says ""Cold Viruses (Human Coronavirus, RSV)"". That's the common cold, the Wuhan Coronavirus is a new type."
Human Coronavirus= the common cold. The Wuhan Coronavirus is a new (novel) type.
Human Coronavirus = the common cold. The Wuhan Coronavirus is a new (novel) type.
