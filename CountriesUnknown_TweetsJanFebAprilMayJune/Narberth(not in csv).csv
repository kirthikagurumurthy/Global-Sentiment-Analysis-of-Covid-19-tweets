So @piersmorgan &amp; other MSM constantly criticise the government on testing etc yet not a word about Labour run Welsh Assembly abandoning all plans to test for Corona virus in care homes in Wales @bbclaurak @BethRigby @Peston @SkyNews @BBCNews -why no outrage about that I wonder?
RT @WelshConserv: It is scandalous that 334 patients at North Wales hospitals were returned to care homes without being tested for #COVID19â€¦
