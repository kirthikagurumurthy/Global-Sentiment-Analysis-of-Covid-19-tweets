I'm more worried about the coronavirus transmission bump from people protesting and rioting than anything else.
My theory is he doesn’t want to shame them by cutting travel because of the ongoing trade deal. As deadly as that may be for the rest of us. And if he’s keeping an eye on Coronavirus like he is social media censorship then we’re probably dead already.
