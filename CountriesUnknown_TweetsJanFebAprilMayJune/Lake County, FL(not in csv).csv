We had two down days in #coronavirus deaths and now we likely have two more over 2k. I was hoping we had turned a corner.
"To the silly person laughing about violating social distancing doesn't realize it will not be ""let's see who gets sick this weekend"" but who is sick two to three weeks from now and who is dead in June and July. #coronavirus"
