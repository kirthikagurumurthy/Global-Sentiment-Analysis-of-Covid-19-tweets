"“Coronavirus is an international ‘public health emergency,' WHO says.” #WHO will not recommend shutting down borders as a containment method, thus there will be no containment of #2019nCoV. — #ahemHEALTH"
"“Coronavirus will 'help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America,' Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says.” The most vile &amp; shortsighted take on #2019nCoV I’ve seen from anyone. — #ahemHEALTH"
" CDC Feb-22 Flu &amp; #ILI California has also released their report of Flu &amp; Influenza-Like Illnesses for week 8. Still elevated over normal, but also trending downward. Next report due Mar-06. — #COVID19 https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/Week2019-2008_FINALReport.pdf#page2"
"CDC releases Flu report for Week 8 (Feb22). Influenza-Like Illness (#ILI) numbers higher than all except 2017, but on downward trend. Perhaps community transmission hasn’t been well established in US yet. Definitely surprises me. — #COVID19 https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm CA report"
"I don’t see any mention in that report of the thousands of people under observation. Presumably they are different from PUI’s thus don’t warrant mentioning. Or is it in the report, & I missed it. Getting woozy trying to scan thru all this stuff. — #COVID19 "
"“CDC aims to have all state & local health departments testing for coronavirus by end of next week.” They’re using previously defective kits, & skipping final phase of test. New kits being sent out are the same defective originals, minus step 3. — #COVID19 https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/health/coronavirus-us-updates-california-patient/index.html"
Retrospective: On Jan-11 Professor Zhang Yongzhen’s team at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre published 1st coronavirus gene sequence on open platforms. China closed lab next day for “rectification”. Transparency not appreciated. — #COVID19 
"They’re testing pets & we can’t even manage to test a few thousand people. smh. — #COVID19 ps: I’m afraid to look, I assume the dog was killed."
"I think the numbers in that article were off. We’ve since been told each test kit has 96 sample wells, implying 19,200 tests total. FDA approved modifying how defective kits are to be used to get “accurate” results. My confidence isn’t high on these #s, or test results — #COVID19"
"Yay! You’re right, CDC updated the #ILI numbers. Still shows decreasing trend, so maybe community transmission hasn’t been well established in US yet. Definitely surprises me. — #COVID19 https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm"
UK: “Weakest would be left to die.” aHEM: “Whaaat?!” — #COVID19 
I know you all are as infuriated as I that ANY decision whether to test for #COVID19 should be based on a concept of scarcity. Talk of using Defense Production Act to force manufacturers to focus on PPE’s would be better focused on rapid 15min test kits. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3546906-white-house-weighs-sweeping-powers-masks-run-short
