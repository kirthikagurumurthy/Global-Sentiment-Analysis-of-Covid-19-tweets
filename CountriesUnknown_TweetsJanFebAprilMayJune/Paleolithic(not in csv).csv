Why are we the only first world country with no test kits? Anyone? #2019nCoV #covid19 
"CDC talking about so few cases in California, like idiots, and the reporter points out the governor said there were only 200 test kits available. CDC's answer? Double talk about it being an evolving situation blah blah blah. #covid19 #2019nCoV"
"And the plan that was supposed to happen a week ago, where we test people with pneumonia that's not the flu at 5 different cities? Maybe next week, who knows. #covid19 #2019nCoV"
"They're apologizing about not being able to test anyone. Lots of double-talk to excuse it. Plans for having test kits like the rest of the planet, but not sure when. In the meantime, just skip the third step in the existing defective test kits, good enough. #2019nCoV #covid19 "
We will see what Communist China has been hiding. #2019nCoV #covid19
