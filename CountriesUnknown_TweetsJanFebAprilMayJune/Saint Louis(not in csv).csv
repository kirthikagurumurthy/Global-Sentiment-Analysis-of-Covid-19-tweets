Nice to see @KennedyNation call out Juan about politicizing everything regarding coronavirus.
Today's #CDC #CoronaVirus #Telebriefing will premiere shortly at https://youtu.be/a-kwsV-rWrw The most important info is always presented on the slow news cycle Fridays. People who are presumptive for #COVID19 infections will now face #PublicHealth actions #NurseTalk #MedEd #COVID
CDC says #Remdesivir #COVID19 treatment questions should be referred to #NIH
CDC says there are two new cases of #COVID19 in US repatriated #DiamondPrincess passengers
#CDC is defending on its lack of #Covid19 testing compared to the rest of world. CDC is severely down playing the #PearlHarbor like loss of #Coronavirus testing capability due to corrupt test reagents. CDC is up playing the border shut down being successful
#CDC just called out on case count being low because CDC has not been testing. CDC's response is that basically #Trump's shutdown of the air corridor with China is responsible for the low number of confirmed cases #Coronavirus #Covid19
"#CDC said the number of USA #COVID19 cases have been so few that they have been able to be aggressive in contact tracing, albeit all tracing has been very close contacts"
"CDC gave only a 2 minute notice on this #telebriefing, as a result there have been no questions and dead air so far #CoronaVirusUpdates #COVID19"
