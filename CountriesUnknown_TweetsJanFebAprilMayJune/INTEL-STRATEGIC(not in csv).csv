@Twitter Trump is blowing the US response to coronavirus because he can't handle bad news
"@Twitter The Trump Administration Fumbled Its Initial Response to Coronavirus. Is There Enough Time to Fix It? More deaths in USA from a virus since the 1960's, more death than the 9 some years of the Vietnam war. TRUMP and the GOP are 100% responsible and still do not care."
