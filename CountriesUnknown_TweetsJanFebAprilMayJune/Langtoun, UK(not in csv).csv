"G'night, tweeps - early for me, but midweek shop tomorrow morning and I like to get there before queues. Scottish govt are pushing masking while shopping hard now, though I think staff might find masked customers (esp me) alarming #coronavirus"
So half of tonight's #Newsnight is anecdote and filler then? I suppose its hard for journalists to do their job under lockdown too.. #coronavirus
"We are ""unrooted"" if we don't have to go into work? Our lives are just about work then, not our own communities; neighbours, friends and relatives. A sad life, if so.. #Newsnight #coronavirus"
"Concerned about novel new diseases? I'd suggest (1) stop farming chickens, a key key incubator, and (2) stop clearing rainforests for agriculture, where most of these diseases originate #BBCQT #coronavirus"
"TBH, I have no problem with Brits returning to UK if *strict quarantine* awaits them as soon as they step off the flight. Govt were originally talking about ""self-isolation"", which sounded crazily irresponsible #BBCQT #coronavirus"
