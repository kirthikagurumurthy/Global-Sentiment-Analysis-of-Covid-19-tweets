"So I appreciate the snark from ancient history. But the point of what I said was if people aren’t getting flu vaccines now, they won’t get the COVID19. To your point, that’s the concern about not getting either vaccine. And yes, both should be free. You can block me now. Thanks"
There’s currently a theory that COVID19 could become an annual/seasonal reality in the same way we have Flu season due to it being 1) easily transmitted 2) 10-14% of cases show no symptoms. Just like Flu. Containing COVID19 just isn’t possible long term.
