I’ll have one coronavirus pls
I work in healthcare and my job just gave us new protocol to screen and attend to patients who could have been exposed to Coronavirus. Be safe y’all.
"The percentage won’t grow. 8000 people died from the flu last year in the US. That’s 2% of all who got sick. It’s the same with this corona virus, 2%."
