GUYS OMG effect of the corona virus 
People are disgusting! Someone just sent me a picture of a coffin saying that’s were I should be bc I’m Asian and could have the coronavirus. JUST BECAUSE THE VIRUS STARTED IM ASIA DOES NOT MEAN ASIANS AUTOMATICALLY HAVE IT! STOP BEING RACISTS AND FIX YOUR OWN LIFE FIRST!
