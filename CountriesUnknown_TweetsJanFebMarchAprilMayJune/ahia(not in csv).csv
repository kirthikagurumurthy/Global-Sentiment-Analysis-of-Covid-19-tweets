"@realDonaldTrump Ok, “ genius,” there are current 60 cases of COVID19 in the US. There’s going to be more. It’s not 15, it’s not close to zero, and it’s not going to suddenly disappear in April. There are many of us fervently hoping you experience it firsthand."
"@realDonaldTrump You don’t know what to do about COVID19, do you? All you care about is that it might hurt your reelection chances, isn’t that right? You stain. People are going to die of this. People that support you. Why? Because they won’t protect themselves."
It’s a great idea but since all the news about COVID19 is supposed to be cleared by Pence you might get shut down. Do it anyway.
