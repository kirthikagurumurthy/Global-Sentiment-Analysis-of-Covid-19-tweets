"China has problems that we never here about in US. I am concerned they won’t manage corona virus. There are Issues with healthcare, personal freedom, sanitation, Human Rights,environmental protection , and a communist culture that forces its people to be untruthful to begin with"
To Any epidemiology/ ID pros etc Do u have info for me re China’s Corona virus ? Don’t we have Corona virus present in US now ? I know I’ve seen this on lab cultures.  Are there many types of Corona virus?where is good info avail on this thank u
I don’t see Corona virus  on there. Is it one with a lipid envelope
