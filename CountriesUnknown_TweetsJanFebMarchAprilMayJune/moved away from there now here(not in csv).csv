"I don't really take anything personally on twitter :)

Just trying to help people prep themselves for possible corona virus impacts, so kind of a hot button (but not emotional)."
"And that's my whole point.

Decouple corona virus from UHC arguments, they are different.

I'm NOT arguing against UHC (tho I also don't really support it because things don't work in a utopian fashion) but arguing against implying that UHC would have slowed COVID-19, it didn't."
