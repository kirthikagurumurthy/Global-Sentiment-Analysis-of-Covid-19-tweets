Covid19 Mortality Rate With Italy hovering 2.5% to 3 % mortality rate. China's reported mortality rate is currently at 3.5 percent Iran with only reporting 388 cases now 210 deaths. 55% ? @NetworksManager
China is skewing numbers using pneumonia as the cause of death not listing the underlying factor Coronavirus. These numbers over there have to be out of control at this point. Bet this started earlier than China announced. Probably thought they could control it.
