I was planning on going to the US this summer and I was disappointed that I couldn't because of coronavirus but now I'm glad I didn't.
*while struggling to breathe because of the SARS brought about by my corona virus and bleeding out of every single orifice brought about by my ebola* NOOOOOO YOU CAN'T TELL ME TO STOP EATING BATS!!!
