Right now we have universal basic income for a month while we hide from the Coronavirus. We can't get people to work in the meat packing plants. Farmers are culling livestock and dumping milk. And Democrats still think this is a good idea... 
"Ventilator, PPE and Coronavirus test shortages were not essential enough to require the Dear Production Act but bacon and ribs... shortsighted decision making less driven by critical need than election strategy."
"I want Trump to explain how such an order puts America 1st? Especially when there has been 1million cases of coronavirus &amp; 60,000 deaths. Now there r widespread cases in ALL of these meat packing facilities. This is NOT American workers 1st, this is American workers sick &amp; dying"
"5 million tests per day sounds low. Why not 10 million tests, why not 15? Donald Trump will say whatever bull that comes dribbling out of his mouth to make it appear that he has the coronavirus under control. If u believe that, I have a condo in Trump Tower Moscow 2 give you."
We've got people at work testing positive for the flu. Add the Corona virus showing up in the US and I'm getting more paranoid by the day.
