And it's really ignorant to just push these jokes. Not only that but you're messing with people's lives. RIGHT HERE IN HOUSTON some girl on Twitter lied that the owner of Jusgo in Bellaire (chinatown) has coronavirus since returning from China- they lost business from that
"idk if it's me but I don't think it was as connected to nationality/race as Coronavirus is. Africa itself was the ignorant association with Ebola, and was seen as dangerous, but Americans are just pointing at people who look Asian and saying they must be infected."
