Trump imploded the #JCPOA and subsequently imposed harsh sanctions which decimated Iran’s health care system (Sanctions that the UN has compared to a blockade and called inhumane and illegal) #Pompeo @GOP have more blood on their hands @CNN @MSNBC @maddow #coronavirus #COVID19

"What about faculty and staff? Does Corona virus not spread amongst them? HEC has given notice that all faculty and staff must still come to ""complete hours"". Every first world country has asked people to work from home which is also logical. Truly shows an ingrained  mentality."
