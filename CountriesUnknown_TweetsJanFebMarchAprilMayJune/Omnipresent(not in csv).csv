We call people like you COVIDIOTS. There's a higher probability of dying by being hit by a skateboarder on the sidewalk than dying from CoronaVirus. Millions died in car crashes wordwide...we don't ban driving autos. #COVIDIOT #EffTheShamdemic
"CORONAVIRUS AND ITS ONSLAUGHT ON CINEMA https://www.northeasttoday.in/2020/05/27/coronavirus-and-its-onslaught-on-cinema/ via @NorthEastToday , well said @girishjohar , looking forward to your candid opinion, more and more."
"Big, If True! RT @realDonaldTrump: Working closely with China and others on Coronavirus outbreak. Only 5 people in U.S., all in good recovery."
"That's about 3.5%... ok it's inching up but 96.5% don't have it or better yet - will not die from it. Having said this #COVID19 reinforces: #China, #Travel, #Tourism, are all overrated."

RT @DeeptimanTY: I think the best way to ensure people observe social distancing and wear masks is to show them the rate card for #COVID19…
It's funny their mullahs were going around saying coronavirus was a plague unleashed by Allah on the kaafirs of the world. Muslims should not even need to test since Allah will surely spare them over everybody else.
"It would really be helpful if both @NYGovCuomo and #BilldeBlasio informed #NYS #NYC where #COVID19 clusters are. then again people are so evil, infected people would travel to where there is no #coronavirus. #PeopleSuck"
