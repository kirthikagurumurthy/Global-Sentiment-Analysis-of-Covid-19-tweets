"I hope that #coronavirus is not weaponized politically. Dr. Anne Schuchat is right....wash your hands regularly, try not to touch your face, wash bathroom hand towels more regularly...

Cut Trump a break so we can move forward in a more positive, unified direction"
"Public threats of #coronavirus today is still low. But no one is underpreparing. They all have been informed & are working on it. 

Panic is not what you should do. Containment strategies have been working, but they have the potential to change quickly.

Trump admin knows this."
