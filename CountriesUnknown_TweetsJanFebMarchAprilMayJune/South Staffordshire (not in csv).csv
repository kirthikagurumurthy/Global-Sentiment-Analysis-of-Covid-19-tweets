Back from business trip in Shanghai. No quarantine necessary acc to PHE. I'm now avoiding that street & places he may go. #British need educating on #coronavirus. A @HotpointSupport man on phone this morning told me there was nothing to worry about as flu kills more. #Hotpointpic.twitter.com/QGfK7dTWKU
"I don't think it is. At my hosp appt Tuesday the HCA coughed over me. I asked if she had #coronavirus? Replied ""No, I haven't been by a Chinese person."" 
If #NHS @NHSEngland staff think it's only from Chinese, God help the rest of us.I'm a Brit & scared of Brit 3 streets from me"
Finding a cure for coronavirus!
@TheJohnSudworth Just seen you on the @BBCNews at 11pm. Thank you for insight into what's really happening with #coronavirus. Stay safe. I hope they find a cure & vaccine soon. 
I read it all. Thank you. Can you ask @BorisJohnson @MattHancock @GavinWilliamson @WHO @PHE_uk @DHSCgovuk @NHSEngland to read it please? More needs to be done. #coronavirus #coronavirusuk #coronaviruschina #coronaviruswuhan 
@BorisJohnson @MattHancock @PHE_uk @DHSCgovuk @CMO_England I think the UK should cancel anything that attracts lots of people. What about @MRCPUK UK PACES exams & risks to patients? #COVID19 #coronavirus #infectionprevention better than #contacttracing.https://twitter.com/abcnews/status/1227711004726960134 …
"@PrincessCruises The passengers really appreciate what the crew and #Captain are doing for all #quarantined on #DiamondPrincess but they are all struggling. #DavidAbel has requested @richardbranson help the Brits out of #COVIDｰ19 #coronavirus nightmare

Not everyone is told to self isolate or quarantine so if they are infected they unknowingly go around spreading it like the #superspreader linked with #Brighton & #Hove case. These guidelines IMO are not adequate to keep every person in the #UK free of #COVID19 #coronavirus
