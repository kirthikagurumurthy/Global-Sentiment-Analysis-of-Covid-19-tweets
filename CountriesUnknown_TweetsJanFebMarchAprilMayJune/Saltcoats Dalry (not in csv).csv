Congratulations. You’ve put us all at risk by failing to see how quick the coronavirus is spreading.
"2020 so far:

- Australia is burning
- WW3 threats
- Coronavirus outbreak 
- Earthquake in Turkey
- Shooting in France
- Helicopter crash kills Kobe Bryant, his daughter and others

End the year already. It’s getting too much, and it’s only January."
