"The number of newly reported #coronavirus cases in Hubei (2147) is the lowest in a week. On the other hand the death toll continues to climb, with another 80 or so fatalities in the past 24 hours."
New daily #Coronavirus cases in China reach nearly 4000 (3887). 3156 of those cases are in Hubei.
"Yesterday saw the first time whereby parts of China itself started restricting inbound travel due from other countries due to the Coronavirus. People from Korea travelling to Yanbian prefecture, Jilin province (A korean minority area) are now required to undergo quarantine."
"The lesson of this week is that ""avoiding China"" is not a catch all quick fix to tackling the Coronavirus. Are we now going to see a mass boycotting of Pizza Parlors and Italian restaurants throughout the world?"
"If the Coronavirus is breaking out in Europe, countries need to restrict Schengen free movement and mandatory place health checks, scanners on national borders, otherwise it's just going to have free reign from country to country."
"Like I said earlier, Coronavirus broke out of international containment this week and started gaining traction in several other countries. What is noteworthy is that a flight ban from China has not been sufficient to spare Italy from an outbreak."
