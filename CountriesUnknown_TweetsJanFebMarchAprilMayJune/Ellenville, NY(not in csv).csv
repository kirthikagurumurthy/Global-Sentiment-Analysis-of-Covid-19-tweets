"Steve i have been trying to tell you for a while the Hubei report was only for new cases of new coronary pneumonia added in Hubei Province...NOT total NEW cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19).
They will now include the non pneumonia cases as well."
They are STILL only reporting new cases of PNEUMONIA associated with Coronavirus.
Plus they are only reporting new cases of Coronavirus PNEUMONIA...
