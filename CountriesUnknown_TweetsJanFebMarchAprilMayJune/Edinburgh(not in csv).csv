Which suggests some coronavirus sequence has been obtained but it is not similar to SARS-cov and if it is just in one patient is probably just residual viral RNA from some other coronavirus.
"Google translate says ‚ÄúFrom the test results obtained so far, ‚Ä¶, but it is really very inclined not to be SARS coronavirus. The homology is very low, with less than 4% gene coverage, making it impossible to judge. Need to test again.‚Äù https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1315590387_4e6a50f301900p0k6.html&prev=search¬†‚Ä¶"
In one way or another I think that must be true. I guess the labs are doing metagenomic sequencing and a fragment of some coronavirus came up (which means little). ‚ÄôSARS‚Äô may be being used in some reports as synonymous with (any) coronavirus.
I guess that means 4% of a coronavirus genome in a patient - you‚Äôd probably find that in a lot of people. Still 4% of coronavirus genome is > 1kb and would be possible to rule out known coronaviruses.
Obviously they need to get this right and be certain it is not an error but finding a new coronavirus in a patient that you had _a priori_ identified as part of a cluster is unlikely not to be important.
A new coronavirus apparently. So my immediate thoughts are that this must be exposure to live animals (probably mammals) in an urban environment. https://twitter.com/greg_folkers/status/1214893479165227008¬†‚Ä¶
