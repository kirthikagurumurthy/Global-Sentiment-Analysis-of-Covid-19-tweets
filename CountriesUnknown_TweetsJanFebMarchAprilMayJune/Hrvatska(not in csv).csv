"She tested negative for Coronavirus. Let's hope she doesn't have influenza, which is deadlier. The cruise ship won't go on lockdown over influenza though"
"I'm very bothered by people giving ""financial advice"" encouraging people to panic over Coronavirus and buy gold. Often these people have a financial interest or want to sell you something. It's insane and dubious"
I'm not entirely sure that current Coronavirus Covid-19 tests can identify a positive result in people who are infected but asymptomatic and/or have a low viral count. Previous tests used globally have not been totally accurate in this regard
Thank you Bryn. Apparently there are two strains of Coronavirus COVID-19. The second strain is less aggressive and milder than the 1st. Immunity to the second strain also provides immunity to the 1st. It would be good to know which strain each positive sample belongs to.
". @SeattleBryn hoping you can help get a hypothesis tested. Hypothesis = high BMR makes people less susceptible to Coronavirus Covid-19 and raising your body temperature through vigorous exercise could trigger a mild immune response that would ""kill"" Coronavirus during incubation"
