"Yeah dude, it’s called the Wuhan coronavirus it’s like y’all dumb just to be dumb"
Spoiler alert: They’re not the same but both Wuhan and SARS are caused by a coronavirus. SARS also had 5x the fatality rate.......
I love all these people trying to mansplain (because they just all so *happen* to be men) the coronavirus to me like I wasn’t living in Taiwan during the SARS outbreak lol
