Supply chains were already moving out of China but the coronavirus outbreak will only accelerate this trend
I put a number of the different types of bailouts that China was doing prior to the coronavirus outbreak into a short video last week. The coronavirus outbreak was truly the absolute last thing that their economy needed https://youtu.be/w6bL_vV74IQÂ 
China has been doing many types of bailouts for awhile now. The coronavirus outbreak was the last thing that their economy needed. Many factories in China have been getting bailouts for over 12 months prior to the coronavirus outbreak.
Lol. I take it you're not doing any prepping for if the coronavirus outbreak gets bad here in the US?
