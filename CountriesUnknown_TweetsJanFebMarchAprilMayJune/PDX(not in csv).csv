"Still encountering this mistake from medical ""experts"", who have gotten everything else wrong about #covid19 also. A 2% current death rate implies a final case fatality rate of 8% to 16%. Now I'm wondering, am I better at this than world's top experts, or are they lying? "
"Oh gee, looks like Huckabee is bucking for a top slot on Trump's ""highly qualified"" #COVID19US taskforce. If I roll my eyes any harder I'm afraid they're going to get stuck. #COVID19 #TrumpVirus"
"New info that a dog has tested + for covid19, which is ridiculous, almost impossible. It's horrifying to think about the brutal deaths waiting dogs in China after this report. I also found out that the Japanese woman might have been tested anally. So no, PCR is just too sensitive"
"The Corona virus has killed 500 people 

The flu killed 10000 people last year. 

Its nothing but fear mongering"
"Average death rate influenza: 1-2%
#Coronavirus ,from initial studies, show a 15 - 20% mortality rate. Hospital med staff don't treat influenza patients wearing biohazard gear. USA creating military site quarantine areas, they don't usually do that for just influenza. #COVID19"
"Health experts are unsure how the coronavirus spread so efficiently on a cruise ship with quarantined passengers.

Seems like a not-so-positive development... https://www.huffpost.com/entry/quarantined-ship-became-coronavirus-incubator_n_5e4c3f2bc5b6b0f6bff089d6 …"
Mike Pence will be diagnosed with coronavirus in 72 hours or less
"coronavirus is a perfect case study of why you need and want a health system where cost is not a barrier and that covers anyone in the country, regardless of immigration status"
"Coronavirus R0 avg (3.3), stays on surfaces 9+ days, norovirus R0 avg (3.7), stays on surfaces 14 days. Very similar. Both typically mild...most critically affect the elderly & immune suppressed. Difference being, one is gastro, one is respiratory.
Media not up in arms over noro."
"Norovirus can also live on surfaces for up to 2wks...again very similar to coronavirus. Noro is gastro, whereas covid19 is respitory...that's the weakness."
"Spreads like Norovirus. Most people don't die from noro, but a handful still do. The R0 avg between #coronavirus (3.3) & norovirus (3.7) is very similar. Noro typcially critically affects those who are elderly or immune compromised...same as what we are seeing w/ #Covid19"
"@etihad @EtihadHelp Are aircraft being disinfected clean in the wake of the #coronavirus #outbreak? As @AUH is a transit point, I would think the possibility of transmission is high. #travel"
"Oh I don't think he'll change for anyone or any reason,  I've known he's trash since the 80's too. But I have hope however small that federal response to the Coronavirus outbreak will improve, despite Trump's best efforts to tank it."
