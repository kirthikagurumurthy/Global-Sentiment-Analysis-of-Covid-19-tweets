"Ok not playing here. I had the regular seasonal flu about 12, 13 years ago. Pneumonia 23 years ago. In both instances, the symptoms came on suddenly. That’s how I’m feeling now. If you’ve had #coronavirus please share with me how you got sick thanks"
"Gee, I feel so confident about how the Trump Administration is handling this situation.
