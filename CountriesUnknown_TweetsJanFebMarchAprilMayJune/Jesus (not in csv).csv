"ummm...a few things are wrong with your comment....the swine flu in 2009 killed anywhere from 100,000 to 700,000, now, if it would have had the death rate of corona virus , it would have been AT THE VERY LEAST anywhere from 14 MILLION to 30 MILLION dead"

I AM NOT arguing that the corona virus has a high recovery ratio, it does indeed"
