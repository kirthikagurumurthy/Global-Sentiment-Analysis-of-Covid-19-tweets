Who knew Corona Virus was not a new Beer? I do not read or watch news. Neighbor: can u believe corona virus is in the US now? Me: “I did not know sounds delicious is it their version of an IPA?” I think he judged me as he told me. Made me want a corona so I came in & will enjoy! pic.twitter.com/mi6boNAPxF
