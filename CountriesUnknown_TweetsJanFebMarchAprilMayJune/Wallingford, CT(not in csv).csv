Did I hear correctly today that the Coronavirus incubation period may be three weeks?
"trump is worried he’ll not have space to quarantine all the infected Coronavirus folks. trump being trump, why doesn’t he just put infected Americans in cages on the border. He can then dump the ones who die into his alligator-filled moat beside the Wall. That’ll keep people out!"
Corona virus has been around for years I have a can of Lysol that’s been sitting in my closet for like 9 months I have hand sanitizer and bleach and all 3 are over 6 months old and say kills corona virus
