"KE has the perfect environment for spreading #Covid19 like a wild fire. We're pushing our luck with this ""self-quarantine"" thingy."
I am just shocked at the kind of stigmatization going on esp against the Chinese people due to #CoVid19 out break.What makes it any different from the stigmization we have all been fighting for decades aganist people living with HIV/AIDs? Humanity is overated 
"It's NOT a lot of time. Italy, South Korea and Iran had positive #COVID19 cases within 48 hrs with soaring 'positive' cases. Within a few days, Italy has LOCKED-DOWN it's Northern region. "

Because it doesn't spare any one. No social class is immune to Corona virus #COVID19 #coronavirusInkenya #CORONAVIRUSOUTBREAK
"So, the #uhurumustgo sets up Mbagathi hospital as isolation centre for covid19 virus from China. Doesn't stop any inbound traffic from the source. They'd rather come with the virus and be quarantined at our cost. This shit sinks in so Differently."
"We have no measures to do so even some equipment used to test temperatures thermo something fail to work sometime when it's overheated. We basically are waiting for our deaths, we ain't got no masks nor the gloves that are used to fight COVID19 only surgical masks nor gloves"
