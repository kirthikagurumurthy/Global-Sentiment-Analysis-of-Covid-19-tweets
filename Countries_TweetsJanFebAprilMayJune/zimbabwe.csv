Bloody hell ! The woman asking the Corona virus question #bbcqt
I think planes bringing Nationals home of likely infected/exposed people from the epicentre of Wuhan who will be at their most infectious/shedding before any symptoms show are what is going to spread the virus around the world. Evacuated too late in my opinion #coronavirus
This is the most inhumane and insensitive statement I have ever read in my lifetime. It only confirms allegations and conspiracies that the #coronavirus is a biological warfare disease. This speaks a lot about Trumps Administration. #CoronavirusOutbreak
#Zimbabwe and #Botswana are ready to sign 7 agreements and MoUs. Yst @edmnangagwa arrived in Bots with his delegation for taking part in the 4-days Zim-Bot Com. It aims to strengthen relations between 2 countries. One MoU will deal with #COVID19 bcz of its rapid spread 
What compassion are you talking about? Their type of compassion where they are having a power struggle in the midst of a world epidemic Covid19 crisis?
#Covid19 now in Nigeria confirmed. So Wuhan is now too far
