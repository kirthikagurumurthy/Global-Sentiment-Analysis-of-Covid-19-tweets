We can’t. China’s Communist government is rarely forthcoming about anything. But I agree with Urback that information coming from China about the coronavirus has been more plentiful as compared to SARS. 
I’ve seen so many white people bring up how it’s the Chinese population’s fault that the corona virus is an epidemic because of what they eat But those same white people would let their dog lick food off their teeth 
The earlier they staunch the spread the better. It's true more people have already died from the seasonal flu this year but left to spread the coronavirus could quickly change that.

Coming back to the “Spanish Flu”: The 100+ years since that pandemic have seen enormous leaps in our ability to deal with disease. So there are good reasons to hope that—with intelligent decisions and swift execution—the #COVID19 epidemic won't be nearly as bad.
"Also, we have a vaccine for measles, but not for #COVID19. And yes, researchers are working hard on one, but it's not going to be available this season. (And it's not clear how long it would remain effective—the seasonal flu mutates so fast that a new vaccine is needed each year)"

Higher number of viruses = more countries shutting down borders/reduction in travel/increase in quarantine = further disruption in supply chain at the same time. Though every major company has dedicated teams mitigating COVID19 impact...tells you the severity to bottom line

I'm about as scared of Covid19 as I am of the flu. While currently the mortality rate of Covid19 is much higher than influenza it also hasn't spread to as many people. As numbers of infected increase the mortality rate will plummet. 80-90% of cases are mild or asymptomatic so...
Tell trump covid19 is on all us currency and especially virulent on golf courses. You'll have full funding that day for healthcare.
Mortality rate Flu is .1. % Rate for covid19 is (at minimum) 2.0% that’s 20 times plus infection rate for flu is .14 and for this virus it’s 2.3 to 4.0.

Some needed perspective on the #Coronavirus #COVID19 from the CDC 
There many unknowns regarding #COVID19 but there also many things we know. @NUSMedicine is publishing a great set of chronicles: https://nusmedicine.nus.edu.sg/medias/news-info/2233-the-covid-19-chronicles

There are no definitive answers to #COVID19 until the pandemic is over. Everyone including virologists are playing guessing games. Only 2 things can be done: prevention and survival. The best option is prevention. Survival is always a guessing game.
Agree; but riddled with challenges; politics trumps collective responsibility; raising global funds for outbreaks hard - both demonstrated in #covid19 - need to readdress duplicated streams of governance between @WHO and @WorldBank
"Can anyone remember if a vaccine was developed for SARS? They say one for COVID19 will take at least a year, if not 18 months, before general availability, which probably means the virus will disappear mostly of its own account. Spanish influenza of 1918 still the most deadly?"
Nothing is certain but yes I think this could get much worse. We can manage cancer care for the patients that need it but getting a surge of #COVID19 patients would be extremely challenging. But yes cancer is devastating and hard to compare it to this.
"What this small study doesn’t say is about 1 in 3 samples in known #COVID19 patients were -ve, and in 1 in 3 patients a negative result was followed by a positive Are false negatives common in infectious patients? "
Hope you survive round 2 of #COVID19 Russian Roulette. These people are just now getting round 2 of infections so we don’t know.
"Because most active ingredients for pharmaceuticals are produced in China, #covid19 might create a new wave of drug shortages. "
Suspect it will be Covid19 but that’s probably part of their eugenicist thinking anyway.

"The most concerning thing Jim is that a significant percentage of those that get #COVID19, get it again. There is no immunity to #coronavirus once you recover."
