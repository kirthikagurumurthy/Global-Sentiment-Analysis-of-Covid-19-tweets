When they tested the animals... did they use covid19 test kits... or just a regular coronavirus test kit? Cause dogs and cats have coronavirus strains that dont affect humans.
BREAKING: The World Health Organization has upgraded the level of the spread of the coronavirus to 'very high'. #COVID19 
'The CDC and the FDA have sped up the process to develop a vaccine or drug through a Deregulatory framework that also allows for testing and trials.' ~ Larry Kudlow on #COVID19
"@WHO isnt going to label it a 'pandemic'... even though it's worse than flu... but if it was the flu, it would have been called one by now! #coronavirus #NCP #nCoV2019 #COVID19 #SARSCoV2"
China’s state TV (CCTV) reporter just asked @WHO during its daily #COVID19 briefing to comment on the origin of the novel coronavirus #SARSCoV2 &amp; if it could have originated outside of China. *Interpretation: CCP propaganda machine is out to shake “sick man of Asia” stigma.

"Coronavirus is now spreading faster outside China. 2,788 deaths 83,773 confirmed cases #COVID2019 #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19 "
are things bound to get worse with #COVID19?
There will NOT be a COVID19 vaccine available in time to prevent a global pandemic. Theyve been working on a SARS vaccine (also a coronavirus) for a decade with no success. Quarantines wont work.
"in addition COVID19 is spreading like a virus making like extra boring, with all the redtrictions and I have got dundruff !"

People with healthy immune systems don’t need to worrry about covid19 it is mild in them BUT they do need to be sensible &amp; considerate of those of us on chemo &amp; other immuno suppressants. It causes viral pneumonia &amp; there are no decent antivirals. 1/2...
