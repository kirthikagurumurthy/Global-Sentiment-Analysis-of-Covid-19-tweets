FUCK ME! This is astounding stupidity! Trump thinks that because markets globally are in free fall due to #COVID19 will adversely affect his re-election campaign it MUST be a hoax perpetrated by @_Democrats #USpoli #Decision2020
All this talk of COVID19 and 'Climate emergency' yet this is far more insidious

The @foreignoffice says it is investigating Japanese news reports that a British man who was aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship has died from #COVID19
"The first step in fighting coronavirus (COVID19) is not to panic but to learn about it's prevention from credible sources. If you send me a message about palm oil, garlic or a prophet that can cure coronavirus, I will block you. You don't have to joke about everything."
You’d expect the job of trump’s Covid19 task force would be to lead the country’s efforts to contain the virus &amp; minimize disruption plus offer citizens practical advice for staying safe. You’d be wrong! It seems their main function is—propaganda! We’re Puerto Rico after Maria.
