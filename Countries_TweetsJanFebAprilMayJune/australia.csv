Just wonder if the National Bushfire Recovery Fund and the Covid19 response will be mangaged with colour-coded spreadsheets exchanged with the PM's office #sportsrorts #COVID2019 #bushfirerelief

It's a great way to avoid #CoVID19 too. #JustSaying
Interesting new companion animal perspective to #COVID19! There've been questions/concerns for a while re the susceptibility and transmission potential of pets. Not surprising given the close physical contact many people have with their pets. The Sha Tin moggie is down 8 lives!! https://twitter.com/rthk_enews/status/1233325347350859777
