Bullshit diplomacy. They should have stopped it in December and they failed. #covid19
"Turbulent times always create shifts in power structures, so infighting in these power structures will increase, with members fighting harder to get to the top. A public well prepared for a crisis might come to the realization that it doesn't need the state after all. #covid19"
"The top priority of the state is always to perpetuate its own existence, it's never about the survival of the general public. That is, policies are chosen to give an appearance of control, not necessarily by what works. Remember that in the weeks and months to come... #covid19"
"#Iran said on Thursday its death toll from #COVID19 had risen to 26, by far the highest number outside China, and the total number of infected people now stood at 245.#coronavirus @WHO @USAdarFarsi"
"Nice initiative of @SZ that visualizes the spreading of #COVID19 in (almost) real time. (On the website that is linked, there is also a legend that tells you how to interpret the colors.) "
 Why are global markets reacting in such a strong way? #Covid19 #Coronavirus @ChelseyDulaney in #Frankfurt @FrankfurtStocks #Stocks #Stockmarket
The IgM hyperimmunoglobulin pentaglobin from the German pharmaceutical company Biotest should work best in severe #COVID19 infections. Pentaglobin has already proven effective against SARS. 
"#COVID19 could be a great test for remote office work, and also for how work is valued when so many jobs depend on a stable environment. Maybe this is also when we will shift our focus to actions that will save this planet?"
World's biggest travel fair could be latest event to be called off due to #COVID19 fears. 
"Cruise ships have been described as ""floating Petri dishes,"" ripe for the spreading of #COVID19. But many in the European industry remain calm and play down the risks. "
#COVID19 remember https://beforeitsnews.com/china/2020/01/nurse-says-coronavirus-quarantine-failing-everyone-will-get-infected-2458463.html
"Aren't such gatherings risky these days, with #COVID19 going round?"
"Studies on household transmission of #covid19 are underway in China, report says. „but preliminary studies ongoing in Guangdong estimate the secondary attack rate in households ranges from 3-10%“"
"Also worth noting that joint mission report on #covid19 points to household transmission as main driver of epidemic: „In China, human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus is largely occurring in families.“"
T-cell count can sink and it is thought that #COVID19 possibly has HIV-like properties 
"'Reinfection' .... yes, ok I'm panicking now. #COVID19 "
"Several doctors claim face masks are useless bc #COVID19 0.12 μm size. But the virus DOES NOT TRAVEL BY ITSELF! Sneezing generates droplets of 0.5–12 μm; masks filter as follows: FFP1 80% of 0.6 μm FFP2 94% of 0.6 μm FFP3 99% of 0.6 μm N95: 95% of 0.3μm Hardly useless, eh? "

This is important: Report of joint @WHO-China mission on #covid19 has just been released. Guess I know what we’ll all be reading today... https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf
Just landed in Sao Paulo and this is the first news I read. Everyone I know was expecting #covid19 cases to be found in sub-Saharan Africa eventually. But still a huge concern. 
Switzerland cancels the Geneva Auto Salon over #COVID19 concerns ... FYI @mohammedhersi
I can only agree with @paulkrugman here. The type of government the US currently has will probably turn out to be a major obstacle to the efficient handling of the #COVID19 epedemic. 
@vmcorman is one of those 24/7 hard working colleagues: Please maintain them in your active thoughts. They are our most precious resource to combat the #Coronavirusgermany #SARS_CoV_2 #pandemic. #COVID19 #healthheroes
"I really would like to know, does the refugees know that we have the covid19 outbreak here in Europe?"
"I was really looking forward to participate in the Hackathon and give a workshop about CMS in the cloud at #Cloudfest 2020. Now the conference was cancelled, due to #COVID19. I guess, it's the right decision, and can only imagine how hard it was taking it for the organizers."
@MoHFW_INDIA is it true that you recommend #Globuli as a prophylactic treatment for #COVID19? As this German physician claims. 
ME MYSELF & I have the following to say: shame on DT shame on Pennyanny SHAME ON USA when it comes to dealing with COVID19 SHAME ON U 
Imagine a virus that spreads as quietly as #covid19 (long incubation period) and is much more lethal. But don't tell the viruses.
"In Italy, the price of face masks is spiralling out of proportion. On Amazon there's an offer of a 'hot deal' of masks, available in a few weeks, by someone who just started the production. #COVID19 brings out the worst in us, also the best. In retrospect we will know who is who."
