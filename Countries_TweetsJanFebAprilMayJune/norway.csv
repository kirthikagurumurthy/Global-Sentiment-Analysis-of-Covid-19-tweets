"Another thing, I had neurological problems as well which we now know can be a symptom of Corona virus. I lost my balance and was extremely dizzy for a week Even though I had an extreme cough for a very long time, I never got really bad from the illness, so I'm glad for that!"
It's becoming increasingly clear that the mystery illness me and my family had in January in northern Italy was corona virus. My dad recovered 3 months ago but he STILL has reduced lung capacity My brother lost sense of taste and smell We had intermittent fever It was not flu
