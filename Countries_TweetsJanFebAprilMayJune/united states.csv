With 170 deaths out of ~7700 cases Corona virus's mortality rate right now sits at about 2%. Influenza is usually 0.1% an order of magnitude less. So the 12-60 thousand deaths from influenza every year in the US come from MILLIONS of people getting infected

There is a reason that entire cities are quarantined and why the incredibly brave health professionals in wuhan won't go home out of fear of infecting their loved ones. They aren't overreacting. The reason is that Corona Virus IS far more deadly than the Flu.
So I'm seeing a lot of commentary on Corona virus and its comparison to Influenza. And as long as Corona Virus is contained and number of cases remains relatively low this NPR piece is absolutely correct. BUT...

"No doubt testing/diagnoses are super important. Without it, we are flying blind. 1. doctors/patients don't know whether COVID19 treatment should be applied. 2. policy makers don't know whether school closures/traffic restrictions should be relaxed or enhanced (2/x no testing)"

"He did not end flights early. Starting Feb3, they rerouted travelers from China to 11 designated airports for screening. If travelers were asymptomatic, they were rebooked to destinations. COVID19 infects when there are no symptoms. So, how many did they let in without testing?"

Coronavirus is a broad term. #Covid19 is a type of #coronavirus but they aren't all the same. It's like dogs. You may get on great with a chihuahua next door but that doesn't mean you aren't cautious with a rottweiler before you know if it wants to kill you.
It's a shame the trump administration believes #COVID19 can be prayed away. We need science to protect us.
NOT LONG ENOUGH!!! Many officials have said NUMEROUS TIMES that the incubation period can be 2-4 weeks!!! Why can’t people hear??? #COVID19

New protocol at Nashville General Hospital prepping for COVID19. 
Flu generally has a cure. COVID19 at this time doesn’t. And I wouldn’t call you not going to E3 or erring on the side of caution “freaking out”. I would describe it as forecasting the worst case scenario with having a tactical mindset. These companies are canceling for a reason
Italy & Iran impacts on spread of #COVID19 ..... 
1. Members on @HouseForeign had questions about aid to Iran because US sanctions have made life-saving medicines and supplies difficult to obtain. This is particularly relevant as #COVID19 spreads in Iran. 2. Members of Congress want to #EndEndlessWar. Not start new ones.
"#TeamTexasHHS is proud to work alongside @GovAbbott, @TexasDSHS, @TDEM, @TexasABC and other Texas agencies to keep Texans healthy. Stay up to date on #COVID19 and the risk to Texas on our website: https://hhs.texas.gov/."
"In what appears to be a first, disease trackers in Singapore have used an experimental antibody test for #COVID19 to confirm that a suspected patient was infected with the #coronavirus."
"As the #coronavirus continues its deadly spread across the globe, #BigLaw firms impose travel restrictions and urge employees to work from home. #COVID19 "
"How can people not see the fact that the medical industry is worth billions maybe even trillions of dollars, and yet there's still no cure for #COVID19 #cancer #AIDS #Alzheimers #diabetes #Parkinsons etc."
The ongoing coronavirus crisis has shone a light on the US FDA's inability to clearly see medical device supply chain troubles to help stave off product shortages #COVID19 
Why does our country only take action once the problem is already upon us instead of stopping it before it starts? We could probably avoid the “inevitable” start of @COVID19 here in the US if we cut off travel to &amp; from affected areas. 
"The symptoms of #COVID19 are unlike a cold, Tedros points out - a dry cough and fever, but no runny nose."
There are actually more deaths each year in the US alone from the common flu. COVID19 has just been weaponized by the Dems. 
Trump's poor response to #COVID19 is destroying my 403b.
"Government requirements that keep laboratories from deploying in-house tests for the #COVID19 virus could slow US response to the disease, AACC says in @washingtonpost. http://ow.ly/NqCA50yyBN4"
The World Health Organization has increased the threat of spreading #Covid19 to “very high”. Just the flu

WH news flash on COVID19. All cases cured. Stock market up 3000. 
This is a must read on #COVID19. I remain surprised at @WHO's consistent messaging that other countries must prepare to take the draconian measures that #China has taken. That is a dark proposition.
