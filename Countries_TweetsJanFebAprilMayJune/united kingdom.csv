COVID19 has stopped people traveling but still that’s not enough 
At the moment it looks like this is a correction caused by the temporary uncertainty due to CoViD19. Chinese production slowing obv has global impact and Italy shows an outbreak can hit a domestic economy hard. Naturally this would slow investment but not necessarily a long trend

This is a very sensible article on #coronavirus - that explodes the myth that it's 'just the flu'. Definitely worth your time to read. #coronavirusuk #COVID19 
"Ask yourself, if you’re on the breadline, know you won’t get sick pay or can’t survive on SSP and you’re showing #Covid19 symptoms what would you do? Self isolate or go and earn the money you need to survive?"
Perhaps it’s time workers were treated fairly? Perhaps it’s about time to get rid of zero hours contracts except for those who actively want them? Perhaps it’s time to even out sick pay? Perhaps it’s time to treat workers as the assets they are. Maybe #Covid19 will show this.
"People are being told to self isolate over corona virus fears. Some will, some however who are on zero hours contracts or don’t get sick pay will feel they have no choice but to go to work despite showing symptoms of #Covid19. Worrying thought!"

"With COVID19, shouldn't children and adults be avoiding this 'pandemic'? I think this virus like climate is being named as an emergency to benefit the usual bunch of glabalist miscreants ... some in illiberal left in the US are calling it Trumpvirus."
"This has, obviously, knock on effects even if you are not personally sick. The distribution of resources is partly why delaying the spread is important. Having covid19 at the same time as seasonal flu is just worse for the system than having them one after the other."
"30,000 people in the UK die from pneumonia each year. That's 80 a day, every day. We have circa 20 so far in total. People need to get it into perspective. And yes, sensible precautions such as washing hands go a long way in helping the spread of Covid19 et al."
"This is the best data sheet I’ve seen yet on who dies from #covid19 - based on over 1,000 deaths (more than 1/3 of all deaths globally) Young children 100% survive, and 99% of all those up to 60. Men over 80 are the most at risk (but most survive) "
"I am not having sleepless nights over Covid19 if it happens it happens. Seasonal flu kills 291,000 to 646,000 people worldwide each year. I think the press are drumming up the headlines because they can’t scare us about Brexit so let’s report on the Covid19 just my personal view"
