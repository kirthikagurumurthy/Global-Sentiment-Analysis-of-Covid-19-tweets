1915,"Fantastic message by @bathebrit: ""We must move from clapping to investing"". Population groups placed at risk by social determinants of #SARSCoV2 exacerbated by policy decisions. Maybe ""clap, then vote""..."
1916,"The probability of u or anyone having contracted the virus in november or December is very unlikely. If you have IgG to SARSCoV2 then you have had the virus. And your argument has merit. If u do not then your argument has no merit. As far as the science goes, it is not probable."
1917,You were a whole freaking boss! Had to stop and look you up! You addressed everything. I've been speaking about the prev research as well as med racisim since #SARSCOV2 began. I'm so grateful! #amazing! #womendoctors.
1918,It still seems unclear who is being encouraged 'back to work' in the UK. I've heard rumours this might include lab-based research scientists. I'm concerned about Universities adequately protecting students/researchers from PIs keen to get labs going. #COVID19 #SARSCoV2 #academia
1919,BCG vaccine may offer protection against SARSCoV2 virus.

1924,"New SARS-like #genome from teased out of #metagenomes. I'm sure many more to find. RmYN02, like RaTG13, is still too distant from #SARSCoV2, to be a direct ancestor. Though exhibits high similarity at several genes (1ab) plus 3 AA insertions at S1/S2 "
1925,"Simple thought experiment: surely there is a lot of 'political will' to find a vaccine against sarscov2 &amp; eradicate covid19 right now, except maybe in the White House. How much is all that political will helping us so far? Now assume the same 'will' to start climate mitigation."
1926,here's one thing #SARSCoV2 can't and won't stop. 
1927,"may be ,,lots of MAYBE's as we re open,, cuz not everyone is being tested,, or screened or anything, and the facts are all over the place mixed with rumors ,,and we can't even name the damn thing by ONE NAME its #SARSCoV2 ,,its SARS 2ND TIME now variation,, nothing new, mutated"

2008,There's very little math or science in the NL #COVID19NL official strategy. They even still don't recognise pre- &amp; #asymptomatic #SARSCoV2 transmissions. Here are the stats about conducted tests per week - only 26624 tests (under 4000 a day)! Reason - less people with symptoms 
2009,"Researchers report in #Science the structure of Remdesivir , an antiviral that's shown promise against the #SARSCoV2 virus, bound to both RNA and the viral polymerase ( nsp12 ) - illuminating the mechanism the drug uses to shut down viral replication. "
